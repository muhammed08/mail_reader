# mail_reader
A software prototype that let blind people use mail (gmail)

Let blind people use gmail with voice. The project itself is not complete as there are many room for improvements

If the software doesnot work, check for these errors:
  try connecting to another network as some firewall block the use of certian protocols used in software
  
  enable imap on your google account
  
The protocols used are imap and smtp.

Task that can be done:
  read new mail
  send new mail
  search mails. (This function is now complete as there are many that is yet to be considered)
